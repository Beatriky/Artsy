          PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASING OR
          USING THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY REACT MOBILE, INC., A
          DELAWARE CORPORATION (“REACT MOBILE,” “WE,” “OUR” OR “US”). IF YOU DO
          NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THEN YOU ARE NOT
          AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS OR USE THE REACT MOBILE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.
          INTRODUCTION; SUBSCRIPTION By accessing or using the React Mobile
          hosted services, products, content, data or other features and
          functionality made available to you by React Mobile (together, the
          “Services”), you are agreeing to comply with these terms of service
          and all policies and guidelines we make available to users of the
          Services from time to time, including without limitation our Privacy
          Policy (https://reactmobile.com/privacy-policy) (together, the “Terms
          of Service”). These Terms of Service are a binding agreement between
          React Mobile and you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”).
          React Mobile reserves the right to modify, supplement, amend, revise
          or otherwise change any of these Terms of Service at any time, but
          only on a prospective, not retroactive, basis. React Mobile will use
          commercially reasonable efforts to provide you thirty (30) days
          advance notice through your invoice or by e-mail to the most recent
          email address associated with your account of any such changes to
          these Terms of Service that would have a materially adverse effect on
          you. Changes will become effective on the next business day following
          the 30-day notice period and, unless you have objected to any changes
          by delivering written notice to React Mobile, you agree to be bound by
          any changes after such 30-day notice period. You represent and warrant
          that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding
          contract, or that if you are registering on behalf of an entity, that
          you are authorized to enter into, and bind the entity to, these Terms
          of Service and register for the Services. The Services are not
          available to individuals who are younger than 13 years old. React
          Mobile may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to
          any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.
          You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service
          are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to
          you and the right to access the Services is revoked where these Terms
          of Service or use of the Services is prohibited and, in such
          circumstances, you agree not to use or access the Site or Services in
          any way. If you have entered into a signed order form, service order,
          subscription agreement, trial agreement or other ordering document
          that specifies your purchase of Services, pricing and related terms (a
          “Subscription Agreement”), that Subscription Agreement together with
          these Terms of Service governs your access to and use of the Services
          and supersedes any separate discussions or representations on this
          topic, including any separate terms you may propose in connection with
          a purchase order or otherwise. The Subscription Agreement will be
          deemed to apply in case of any conflict between these Terms of Service
          and the Subscription Agreement. GRANT OF LICENSE; RESTRICTIONS Subject
          to your compliance with these Terms of Service, React mobile hereby
          grants to you, during the period of time stated in any Subscription
